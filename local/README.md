# Jenkins linting

You can configure this jenkins instance as you wish, if so please change:

* configs/jenkins.yaml using the [JCasC](https://jenkins.io/projects/jcasc/)
* plugins.txt


The current baseline was based on what the @infra provides us.

You can use the [plugins.txt](https://github.com/elastic/infra/blob/master/docker/jenkins/configs/plugins.txt) as a reference.
