Matrix parallel task execution in parallel implemented on a step.
It compose a matrix of parallel tasks, each task has a set of enviroment variables
created from the axes values.

* **agent:** Jenkins agent labels to provision a new agent for parallel task.
* **axes :** Vector of pairs to define enviroment variables to pass to the parallel tasks,
each pair has a variable name and a vector of values (see #axis)
* **excludes :** Vector of pairs to define combinations of enviroment variables to exclude
when we create the parallel tasks (axes-excludes=parallel tasks).
