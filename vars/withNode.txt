Wrap the node call for three reasons:
  1. with some latency to avoid the known issue with the scalability in gobld.
  2. enforce one shoot ephemeral workers with the extra/uuid label that gobld provides.
  3. allocate a new workspace to workaround the flakiness of windows workers with deleteDir.


```
  // Use the ARM workers without any sleep or workspace allocation.
  withNode(labels: 'arm''){
    // block
  }

  // Use ephemeral worker with a sleep of up to 100 seconds and with a specific workspace.
  withNode(labels: 'immutable && ubuntu-18', sleepMax: 100, forceWorspace: true){
    // block
  }
```

* labels: what's the labels to be used. Mandatory
* sleepMin: whether to sleep and for how long at least. Optional.
* sleepMax: whether to sleep and for how long maximum. Optional.
* forceWorkspace: whether to allocate a new unique workspace. Optional.
