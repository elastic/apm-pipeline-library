/**
Takes a GitHub release that is written as a draft and makes it public.

This script is designed to be used in conjunction with githubReleaseCreate().
The normal workflow when using the two scripts together is to first create a
release with githubReleaseCreate() and setting the `draft` flag to `true`. Then,
once a human reviews the proposed release, this script can then be used to
make the release public.

If githubReleaseCreate() was called with the `draft` flag set to `false`,
this has no effect.

The `id` field required by this script is accessible in the return from
ithubReleaseCreate(). See documentation for that script for more details about
the data structure of the return.

  Example invocation:

    githubReleasePublish(
      id: '1',                // Release ID
      name: 'Release v1.0.0', // Release name 
    )

To learn more about what individual flags mean, please visit the GitHub
documentation page on releases:

  ]

  // Call the GitHub API

  return ret
