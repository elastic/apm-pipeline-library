This step parses the given list of branch aliases and return
the branch name.

This is handy to support a dynamic branch generation without the need to
update the name of the branch when a new minor release branch is created.

```
// Return the branch name for the main, 8.minor and 8.next-minor branches
def branches = getBranchesFromAliases(aliases: ['main', '8.<minor>', '8.<minor-minor>'])

```


* aliases: the branch aliases (supported format major.<minor>, major.<next-patch>, major.<next-minor>). Mandatory
