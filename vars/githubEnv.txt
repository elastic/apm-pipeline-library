* `ORG_NAME`: id the organization name in the git URL, it sets this environment variable processing the GIT_URL.
* `REPO_NAME`: repository name in the git URL, it sets this environment variable processing the GIT_URL.
* `GIT_SHA`: current commit SHA1, it sets this getting it from local repo. Deprecated, uses `GIT_COMMIT` instead
