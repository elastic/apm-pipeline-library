Upload the given pattern files to the given bucket using an opinionated folder structure:

* <repo>/snapshots             -> if a branch.
* <repo>/pull-requests/pr-<id> -> if a Pull Request.
* <repo>/commits/<git-commit>  -> regardless of the type of a build.

Snapshots and pr-<id> folders might contain files that are overridden while `commits/<git-commit>` are
not overridden once they are created.

```
  uploadPackagesToGoogleBucket(pattern: 'file.txt', bucket: 'bucket', credentialsId: 'foo', repo: 'foo')
```

* repo: The GitHub repository name. Optional. Default to `REPO`
* bucket: The Google Storage bucket name. Optional. Default to `JOB_GCS_BUCKET`
* credentialsId: The credentials to access the repo (repo permissions). Optional. Default to `JOB_GCS_CREDENTIALS`
* pattern: The file to pattern to search and copy. Optional. Default to `build/distributions/**/*`
* folder: The folder to be added to the calculated bucket uri folder. Optional.

NOTE: It works with the Multibranch Pipeline only, therefore it requires to use `gitCheckout` to be able to populate the
      gitBaseCommit.
