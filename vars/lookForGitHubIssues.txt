If the current build is a PR, it would return true if the given label
matches with the list of assigned labels in the PR.

  ```
  whenTrue(matchesPrLabel(label: 'foo')) {
    ...
  }
  ```

NOTE: `ORG_NAME` and `REPO_NAME` environment variables are required, so `gitHubEnv` step is the one in charge
