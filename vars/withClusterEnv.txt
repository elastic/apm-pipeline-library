Wrap the credentials and entrypoints as environment variables that are masked
for the Cloud deployments, aka clusters.

```
  withClusterEnv(cluster: 'test-cluster-azure') {
    // block
  }
```

* cluster: Name of the cluster that was already created. Mandatory
* kibana: Whether to configure the environment variables with the Kibana URL. Optional

NOTE: secrets for the test clusters are located in Vault, see `getTestClusterSecret`
