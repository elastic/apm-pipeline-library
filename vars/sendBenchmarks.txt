Send the benchmarks to the cloud service or run the script and prepare the environment
to be implemented within the script itself.

### sendBenchmarks

Send the file to the specific ES instance. It does require Go to be installed beforehand.

```
sendBenchmarks()
```

```
sendBenchmarks(file: 'bench.out', index: 'index-name')
```

* *file*: file that contains the stats.
* *index*: index name to store data.
* *url*: ES url to store the data.
* *secret*: Vault secret that contains the ES credentials.

### sendBenchmarks.prepareAndRun

Run the script and prepare the environment accordingly. It does delegate the sending of the data
to ES within the script itself rather than within the step.


```
sendBenchmarks.prepareAndRun(secret: 'foo', url_var: 'ES_URL', user_var: "ES_USER", pass_var: 'ES_PASS')
```
* *secret*: Vault secret that contains the ES credentials.
* *url_var*: the name of the variable with the ES url to be exposed.
* *user_var*: the name of the variable with the ES user to be exposed.
* *pass_var*: the name of the variable with the ES password to be exposed.
