Provides the specific traditional URL tab for the current build/run

Tab refers to the kind of available pages in the traditional view. So far:
* pipeline -> aka the build run (for BO compatibilities)
* tests
* changes
* artifacts
* cobertura
* gcs


```
def testURL = getTraditionalPageURL('tests')
def artifactURL = getTraditionalPageURL('artifacts')
```
