Generate a Go benchmark report by comparing the existing benchmark with
the `TARGET_BRANCH` variable if exists.

This particular step is quite opinionated:
- It relies on the `TARGET_BRANCH` to generate the diff to compare with.
- CI builds archive their go benchmark report in the root folder.
- It uses Golang to run the benchmark.
- It produces a file with the name `bench.diff`

```
  // This will create a diff report with the name `bench.diff` in the build folder.
  generateGoBenchmarkDiff(file: 'bench.out', filter: 'exclude')
```

* file: The name of the file to be compared with. Mandatory
* filter: Whether to apply a filter in the diff. Values: `none`, `exclude`. Optional (default: `none`)

_NOTE_: It only supports *nix.
