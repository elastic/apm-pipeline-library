Find the oldest stack version given the condition to compare with.

If the version doesn't exist yet, it will try to use the closer snapshot, for example
if 7.14.1 doesn't exist, it will try to use 7.14.1-SNAPSHOT or 7.x-SNAPSHOT,
this will allow to develop integrations with unreleased features.


```
findOldestSupportedVersion(versionCondition: "^7.14.0")
```

* versionCondition: The condition to compare with. Mandatory
