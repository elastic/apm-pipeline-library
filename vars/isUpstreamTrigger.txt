Check if the build was triggered by an upstream job, being it possible to add some filters.

```
def upstreamTrigger = isUpstreamTrigger()
def upstreamTrigger = isUpstreamTrigger(filter: 'PR-')
```

* filter: The string filter to be used when selecting the ustream build cause. If no filter is set, then 'all' will be used.
