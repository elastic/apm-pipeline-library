Find the branch name for a stack version in the Artifacts API given the conditions to compare with.

The step supports passing a minor version, returning the branch name including that minor (i.e. 7.15), or passing a version token in the
'<minor>' format. This format supports passing an index, separated by the minus operator: '<minor-1>', which will retrieve the previous
version for the last minor. If the index overflows the number of the total existing minors, the first minor will be retrieved (i.e.
'<minor-1999>').

The more common use case is when there are two minor versions in development at the same time: 7.16 and 7.17

```
  getBranchNameFromArtifactsAPI(branch: '7.0')
  getBranchNameFromArtifactsAPI(branch: '7.<minor>')
  getBranchNameFromArtifactsAPI(branch: '7.<minor-1>')
  getBranchNameFromArtifactsAPI(branch: '7.<minor-2>')
```

* branch: the branch name or supported pattern. Mandatory
