If the current build is a PR, it would check if it is approved or created
by a user with write/admin permission on the repo or a trusted user.

If it is not approved, the method will throw an error.

```
githubPrCheckApproved()
```

NOTE: `REPO_NAME` env variable is required, so gitHubEnv step is the one in charge

```
githubPrCheckApproved(org: 'elastic', repo: 'apm-pipeline-library', changeId: 1000, token: "env.GITHUB_TOKEN")
```

* *org:* GitHub organization/owner of the repository (by default ORG_NAME).
* *repo:* GitHub repository name (by default REPO_NAME).
* *changeId:* Pull request ID number (by default CHANGE_ID).
* *token:* GitHub token to access to the API (by default [getGithubToken()](#getGithubToken)).
