If the current build is a PR, it would check if it is approved or created
by a user with write/admin permission on the repo or a trusted user.

If it is not approved, the method will throw an error.

```
githubPrCheckApproved()
```

NOTE: `REPO_NAME` env variable is required, so gitHubEnv step is the one in charge
