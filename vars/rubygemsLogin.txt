Login to Rubygems.com with an authentication credentials from a Vault secret.
The vault secret contains `user` and `password` fields with the authentication details. Or if using `withApi` then
it's required the vault secret with `apiKey`.

```
rubygemsLogin(secret: 'secret/team/ci/secret-name') {
  sh 'gem push x.y.z'
}

rubygemsLogin.withApi(secret: 'secret/team/ci/secret-name') {
  sh 'gem push x.y.z'
}
```

* secret: Vault secret where the user, password or apiKey are stored.
