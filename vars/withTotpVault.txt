Get the totp code from the vault, define the environment variables which have been
passed as parameters and mask the secrets

the totp must have this format
```
{
  "request_id": "abcdef4a-f9d6-ce93-2536-32c3bb915ab7",
  "lease_id": "",
  "lease_duration": 0,
  "renewable": false,
  "data": {
    "code": "123456"
  },
  "warnings": null
}
```

withTotpVault(secret: 'secret', code_var_name: 'VAULT_TOTP'){
  //block
}
