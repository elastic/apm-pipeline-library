Perform a checkout from the SCM configuration on a folder inside the workspace,
if branch, repo, and credentialsId are defined make a checkout using those parameters.

For security reasons PRs from not Elastic organization or with write permissions 
on the repo are block at this point see [githubPrCheckApproved](#githubPrCheckApproved), 
whoever if you login in the Jenkins UI, it would be always possible to trigger 
the job manually from the Jenkins UI.
