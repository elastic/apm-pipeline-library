Fetch the current build status for a given job
```
def status = buildStatus(host: 'localhost', job: ['apm-agent-java', 'apm-agent-java-mbp', 'master']), return_bool: false)
```

* host: The Jenkins server to connect to. Defaults to `localhost`.
* job:  The job to fetch status for. This should be a list consisting of the path to job. For example, when viewing the Jenkins
        CI, in the upper-left of the browser, one might see a path to a job with a URL as follows:

            https://apm-ci.elastic.co/job/apm-agent-java/job/apm-agent-java-mbp/job/master/

        In this case, the corresponding list would be formed as:

            ['apm-agent-java', 'apm-agent-java-mbp', 'master']

* as_bool: Returns `true` if the job status is `Success`. Any other job status returns `false`.
* ssl: Set to `false` to disable SSL. Default is `true`.
