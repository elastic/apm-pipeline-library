  Return true if the build status is FAILURE or UNSTABLE
  The status of the build changes when a stage ends,
  This means that the `isBuildFailure` step will not return the status of the build after the current stage,
  It returns the status of the build after previous stage.
  If you use this step on `post` stages the result is accurate,
  but in this cases it is better to use the [post stages](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#post)

  ```
  if(isBuildFailure()){
    echo("The build failed")
  }
  ```
