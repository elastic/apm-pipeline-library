ApmCli report APM transactions/span to an APM server.

```
apmCli(
  apmCliConfig : "secrets/oblt/apm",
  serviceName : "service01"
)
```

```
apmCli(
  apmCliConfig : "secrets/oblt/apm",
  serviceName : "service01",
  transactionName : "test",
  spanName : "ITs",
  spanCommand: "make run-its",
  spanLabel: '{"type": "IT"}'
)
```

```
apmCli(
  url : "https://apm.example.com:8200",
  token: "${TOKEN}"
  serviceName : "service01",
  transactionName : "test",
  spanName : "ITs",
  spanCommand: "make run-its",
  spanLabel: '{"type": "IT"}'
)
```

* apmCliConfig : Vault secret to read the `url` and `token` of the APM server.
(`{"value": {"url": "https://apm.example.com:8200", "token": "WS1DFER1WES2"}}`)
* serviceName : the service name used to report the APM data,
if the environment variable `APM_CLI_SERVICE_NAME` and no value set
the `APM_CLI_SERVICE_NAME` value is used by default.
It is mandatory to pass a serviceName. If a service name is no passes apmCli do nothing.
* url : The URL of the APM server (conflicts with apmCliConfig)
* token : The token to access the APM server (conflicts with apmCliConfig)
* saveTsID : if true the current transaction ID is saved on a text file (tsID.txt)
and the `APM_CLI_PARENT_TRANSACTION` environment variable is defined.
* transactionName: Name of the transaction to report, it is mandatory.
By default the "STAGE_NAME" environment variable is used.
* parentTransaction: Allow to group several transactions as childs of another (distributed tracing)
* spanName : Name of the span to report.
* spanCommand Command to execute as span,
if spanName is no set, spanCommand param would be used as span name.
* spanLabel : label to add to the span (`{"type": "arabica"}`)
* result : Result of the transaction, the default values is `success`

You can enable apm traces by configuring the [pipelineManager](#pipelinemanager) step,
by default it set the `APM_CLI_SERVICE_NAME` to the value of `JOB_NAME`

```
  pipelineManager([ apmTraces: [ when: 'ALWAYS' ] ])
```
