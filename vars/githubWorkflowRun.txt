       workflow: "build.yml",
       ref: "main",
       parameters: [path: "filebeat"],
       credentialsId: "github-workflow-token"]
    def runId = githubWorkflowRun.triggerGithubActionsWorkflow(args)
    def runInfo = githubWorkflowRun.getWorkflowRun(args + [runId: runId])
  }

```

### Requirements for workflows to be compatible with githubWorkflowRun.


1. Inputs in workflow should have id parameter:

```
    inputs:
      id:
        description: 'Run ID'
        required: true
```

2. The first step in workflow should be following step:

```
    - name: ${{ format('Run ID {0}', github.event.inputs.id) }}
      run: echo Run ID ${{github.event.inputs.id}}
```
