# Guidance on coding patterns

## EditorConfig

To ensure a common file format, there is a `.editorConfig` file [in place](../.editorconfig). To respect this file, [check](http://editorconfig.org/#download) if your editor does support it natively or you need to download a plugin.

### Commit Message Style

Write [meaningful commit messages](http://who-t.blogspot.de/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html) and [adhere to standard formatting](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Good commit messages speed up the review process and help to keep this project maintainable in the long term.
